   * EXERCISE 1 (Basic): Test the daysBetween() function
   *
   * HINTS:
   * - daysBetween(date1, date2) returns the number of days between two dates
   * - Create dates using: new Date("2024-03-01") and new Date("2024-03-15")
   * - The result should be 14 days
   * - The function returns absolute value (order doesn't matter)

  });

  /**
   * EXERCISE 2 (Complex): Test date arithmetic across month and year boundaries
   *
   * HINTS:
   * - addDays(date, days) adds days to a date
   * - Adding days across month boundary:
   *   - new Date("2024-01-30") + 5 days → February 4
   *   - Check: result.getMonth() === 1 (February), result.getDate() === 4
   *
   * - addMonths(date, months) adds months to a date
   * - Jan 31 + 1 month rolls to March (Feb doesn't have 31 days)
   *   - new Date("2024-01-31") + 1 month → March (month 2)
   *
   * - addYears(date, years) adds years to a date
   * - Leap year transition:
   *   - new Date("2024-02-29") + 1 year → March 1, 2025 (Feb 29 doesn't exist in 2025)
   *
   * - Negative arithmetic:
   *   - new Date("2024-03-15") - 20 days → February (month 1)

   * EXERCISE 3 (Complex): Test leap years and days in month calculations
   *
   * HINTS:
   * - isLeapYear(year) returns true/false

   *   - 2023 → false (not divisible by 4)

   * - getDaysInMonth(date) returns number of days in that month
   *   - February 2024 (leap year) → 29 days
   *   - February 2023 (non-leap) → 28 days
   *   - January → 31 days
